<!--

Thank you very much for contributing to task-hookrs.

Please notice: I, the author of task-hookrs, am currently on a sabatical (May 2018
until early 2019). I am not sure whether I will have access to the internet
during that time. I may respond slowly - delay of 2-4 weeks or even more are
possible! I hope it won't be more.

With task-hookrs, the situation is a bit different as with my other
repositories. @maralorn has commit access and is actively developing this
library (as of the time of writing this note). I'm sure they will respond much
faster than I can - and I trust them to do the right thing.

@TheNeikos has commit rights as well (as a backup).
